#Docker Compose vs Docker Swarm

[1. Docker Compose](compose.md)

	>Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a Compose file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, using a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.


[2. Docker Swarm](swarm.md)

	Swarm Mode enables the ability to deploy containers across multiple Docker hosts, using overlay networks for service discovery with a built-in load balancer for scaling the services. Swarm Mode is managed as part of the Docker CLI, making it a seamless experience to the Docker ecosystem.
